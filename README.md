Embaarking on a project involving c++ programming languages ,coupled with the utilization of Linux commands gave me a good learning experience.Through such a project, I gained a better understanding of software engineering rpinciples,computer science fundamentals,commands,syntax.As, I have learnt c++ code now, debugging the code and the syntax were the essential and required concepts for the given task#1. Additionally, working within the Linux environment can enhance one's ability to navigate and utilize the command line, manage processes, files, and memory, and compile code effectively. The project may also offer insights into the importance of cross-platform development and the nuances of different operating systems, as well as the opportunity to engage with a variety of development tools that are particularly prevalent in the Linux ecosystem.When embarking on a project involving C++ and C languages, along with Linux commands, I learnt a multitude of concepts. In C++, key areas of focus include understanding object-oriented programming, mastering the use of classes, constructors, destructors, and understanding the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. For C, the learning curve involves grasping low-level programming constructs, pointers, memory management, and the manipulation of strings and arrays. Linux commands will introduce you to the Unix-like environment, teaching you file management, process control, and system administration. Commands such as ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, mv, cp, and rm are fundamental for navigation and manipulation of the filesystem.This journey will not only enhanced my technical skills but also developed my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of computer science fundamentals.I gained some knowledge on topics like header files, functions,image processing concept,snippet idea, different layers of the image(rbg), logic for playing with numbers.Strong dose was really interesting than medium dose. Medium dose is literally easy compared to strong dose. Strong dose involved 2 codes named playing with numbers and playing with images.Playing with numbers involved a good logic which must be best and efficient in terms of time complexity and space complexity.In this function takes an integer n as input and counts the number of distinct prime factors of n. It iterates through integers from 2 up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by i, it increments the count and divides n by i until n is no longer divisible by i. After the loop, if n is greater than 1, it means n itself is a prime factor, so it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.Light dose involves some ubuntu commands.I have submitted in the form of screenshot of some commands in the form of a story.Medium Dose involves some basic logic and gave a good experience.Writing this code likely provided a multifaceted learning experience. Firstly, it involves the use of structures in C++, which are fundamental data types that group variables of different types under a single name. Implementing a lambda function for the print statement is an advanced feature that teaches about anonymous functions and their utility in modern C++. The use of the 'auto' keyword for type inference introduces a convenient way to declare variables without explicitly stating their type, which can make the code cleaner and more readable. Additionally, the process of assigning values to the members of a structure and then using those values within a program helps in understanding the flow of data within a C++ application. Overall, this exercise would enhance one's understanding of C++ syntax, structures, lambda expressions, and the auto keyword, while also providing practical experience in implementing these concepts in a simple program.I learnt few things about lambda functions and it's applications.Lambda functions in programming, particularly in C++, are a powerful feature that can be used in a variety of applications due to their flexibility and conciseness. They are often used in algorithms that require custom comparison logic, such as sorting a vector of custom objects. Lambda functions are also utilized in event-driven programming, where they can be passed as callbacks to handle events without the need for defining separate functions. In GUI applications, they can simplify the process of connecting signals and slots, making the code more readable. Furthermore, they are useful in functional programming paradigms within C++, such as in the use of map, filter, and reduce operations on collections. They can also be employed in concurrent programming to encapsulate tasks that will be run on separate threads. Overall, lambda functions provide a convenient and efficient way to define anonymous functions inline, streamlining the code and enhancing its maintainability.Finally, I learnt a lot of things mainly image processing while doing this project.While the second code gave a different experience like writing code, especially when it involves creating a hierarchy of classes, is an enlightening experience that hones one's object-oriented programming skills. In the process of developing this particular code, I learnt about the importance of class relationships and how objects interact within a system. The use of pointers to create dynamic objects and the implementation of member functions to add and communicate between objects are crucial aspects that reflect real-world organizational structures. Moreover, managing memory through dynamic allocation and understanding the flow of control in a program with multiple objects are valuable skills gained.
