Embaarking on a project involving c++ programming languages ,coupled with the utilization of Linux commands gave me a good learning experience.Through such a project, I gained a better understanding of software engineering rpinciples,computer science fundamentals,commands,syntax.As, I have learnt c++ code now, debugging the code and the syntax were the essential and required concepts for the given task#1. Additionally, working within the Linux environment can enhance one's ability to navigate and utilize the command line, manage processes, files, and memory, and compile code effectively. The project may also offer insights into the importance of cross-platform development and the nuances of different operating systems, as well as the opportunity to engage with a variety of development tools that are particularly prevalent in the Linux ecosystem.When embarking on a project involving C++ and C languages, along with Linux commands, I learnt a multitude of concepts. In C++, key areas of focus include understanding object-oriented programming, mastering the use of classes, constructors, destructors, and understanding the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. For C, the learning curve involves grasping low-level programming constructs, pointers, memory management, and the manipulation of strings and arrays. Linux commands will introduce you to the Unix-like environment, teaching you file management, process control, and system administration. Commands such as ls, pwd, cd, mkdir, mv, cp, and rm are fundamental for navigation and manipulation of the filesystem.This journey will not only enhanced my technical skills but also developed my problem-solving abilities and deepened my understanding of computer science fundamentals.I gained some knowledge on topics like header files, functions,image processing concept,snippet idea, different layers of the image(rbg), logic for playing with numbers.Strong dose was really interesting than medium dose. Medium dose is literally easy compared to strong dose. Strong dose involved 2 codes named playing with numbers and playing with images.Playing with numbers involved a good logic which must be best and efficient in terms of time complexity and space complexity.In this function takes an integer n as input and counts the number of distinct prime factors of n. It iterates through integers from 2 up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by i, it increments the count and divides n by i until n is no longer divisible by i. After the loop, if n is greater than 1, it means n itself is a prime factor, so it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count.In c lang we use header file named stdio.h.We use some functions named imread and mat(object called image) which is used to store.Here, a threshold value is set to (160,160,160) indicating three set of layers that is Blue, Green, Red.These values for pixels are considered as type A.TypeA_count and similarly typeB_count are initialised to have the update value of number of pixels which are under typeA and typeB.Next, cvtColor, function which is used to convert the loaded image to grayscale.To view each pixel of the image, we use nested loops.For each pixel, it checks if the BGR values are greater than the threshold values. If they are, the pixel is classified as typeA and typeA_count is incremented; otherwise, it's classified as typeB and typeB_count is incremented.The brightness level is set to 150.Pixels above the brightness level are set to white(255) and below or equal to are set to black(0).To get black and white coloured areas, bitwise_not function is used.And they are displyed using imshow.Light dose involves some ubuntu commands.I have submitted in the form of screenshot of some commands in the form of a story.Medium Dose involves some basic logic.Finally, I learnt a lot of things mainly image processing while doing this project.
